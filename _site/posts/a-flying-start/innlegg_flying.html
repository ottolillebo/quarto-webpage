<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Maternity leave policies have been central to discussions on how to best support families. In a widely cited study from 2015, <span class="citation" data-cites="carneiro2015flying">Carneiro, Løken, and Salvanes (<a href="#ref-carneiro2015flying" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> (CLS) claimed that extending paid maternity leave in Norway led to substantial benefits for children, including higher educational achievement and increased earnings later in life. This was interpreted as proof that early parental leave offers children a “flying start” in life.</p>
<p>However, our examination of this claim, based on a closer look at how the policy was implemented, shows that the paper by CLS was based on an uncorrect understanding of the reform. Rather than an introduction of payed maternity leave, the reform was actually an extension of existing benefits from 12 to 18 weeks. In this post we`ll discuss how this affect the original study’s empirical approach, and how JPE delt with our findings and the process of getting a comment published in JPE.</p>
<p>The original article can be found <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/679627">here</a>, or ungated <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/1956/17157">here</a>. Our ungated (note that our article is gated at JPEs website) can be found here and CLS’ (ungated at JPEs website) reply to us can be found here.</p>
</section>
<section id="background" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The 1977 reform in Norway was described by CLS as introducing paid maternity leave for the first time. However, the reform actually extended the existing paid leave by five to six weeks. The implementation of this extension was also gradual, applied at different times for various employment sectors.</p>
<p>This is important because the original analysis relied on the assumption that only mothers giving birth after a specific date (July 1, 1977) were entitled to paid leave, and this served as the basis for the claimed benefits to children. We show that this assumption was incorrect. There was no sharp difference between mothers giving birth before and after the cutoff date, and therefore, the reported effects cannot be attributed to the reform in the way previously suggested.</p>
<p>Our analysis raises questions about important aspects of the CLS study:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Reform characterization</strong>: We show that the 1977 reform extended existing paid leave from 12 to 18 weeks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation timeline</strong>: We show that the reform were implemented in stages (January 1, May 1, and July 1) depending on the mother’s employment sector, rather than on a single date.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Methodology considerations</strong>: We conclude that the discontinuity used by CLS to identify the causal effects never existed, and the analysis thus builds on an invalid identification strategy and an erroneous interpretation of the evaluated treatment effect.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This reexamination highlights the complexity of policy research and the importance of continual review and discussion of influential studies. As the debate on parental leave policies continues, it’s valuable to consider multiple perspectives and interpretations of historical reforms and their impacts. We also note that other researchers have referenced the study’s description of the reform in their own work. Notably <span class="citation" data-cites="butikofer2021impact">Bütikofer, Riise, and M. Skira (<a href="#ref-butikofer2021impact" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span></p>

<section id="norways-1977-maternity-leave-reform" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="norways-1977-maternity-leave-reform">Norway’s 1977 Maternity Leave Reform</h2>
<p>The CLS study described the reform as: - Increasing mandatory paid maternity leave from 0 to 18 weeks - Raising compensation to 100% of pre-birth salary - Extending unpaid leave from 12 to 52 weeks, in addition to the 18 paid weeks</p>
<p>However, historical records shows a completely different picture: - Paid maternity leave actually increased from 12 (or 13 in the public sector) to 18 weeks - Paid maternity leave had existed in Norway since at least the 1930s - The raise to 100% compensation was implemented a year later, on July 1, 1978 - The total leave period (paid plus unpaid) was extended to 52 weeks, not 52 weeks on top of paid leave</p>
<p>The CLS study claimed: - A sharp discontinuity in entitlement on July 1, 1977 - Poor media coverage, making the reform largely unexpected</p>
<p>Our findings shows: - The reform was implemented in stages: January 1 for state employees, May 1 for other public sector workers, and July 1 for the private sector - The extension was phased in, applying to births in the months preceding each implementation date - There was significant media coverage and political discussion of the reform in the years leading up to 1977</p>
<p>These discrepancies raise important questions about the study’s methodology and conclusions. The lack of a sharp discontinuity in entitlement and the more gradual nature of the reform’s implementation challenge the study’s analytical approach.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Katrine-Loken/publication/228788935_A_flying_start_Maternity_leave_and_long-term_outcomes_for_mother_and_child/links/0fcfd508e7c26196cc000000/A-flying-start-Maternity-leave-and-long-term-outcomes-for-mother-and-child.pdf">earlier working paper from 2008</a>, provided a more accurate description of the reform. Here, the authors write on page 10:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In 1956 the maternity leave benefits became common to women in Norway through the introduction of compulsory sickness insurance for all employees. The length of the maternity leave was 12 weeks, but the compensation varied substantially (<span class="citation" data-cites="ronsen2002family">(<a href="#ref-ronsen2002family" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>ronsen2002family?</strong></a>)</span>).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> From July 1st 1977 paid maternity leave was extended to 18 weeks and unpaid maternity leave up to one year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a new <a href="https://ekstern.filer.uib.no/svf/2010/WP0610.pdf">working-paper</a> published online in 2010, the text about the reform was the following:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>On July 1st, 1977, Norway saw the introduction of paid maternity leave and an increase in unpaid leave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This evolution in the study’s presentation of the reform highlights the complexity of policy research and the importance of thorough historical verification.</p>

<section id="identification" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="identification">Identification</h2>
<p>The CLS study on Norway’s 1977 maternity leave reform reported significant positive effects on children’s educational attainment and adult earnings. However, a closer examination of their methodology and data raises some important questions.</p>
<section id="the-approach-by-cls" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-approach-by-cls">The Approach by CLS</h3>
<p>CLS used several statistical techniques to identify the effects of the reform:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Single-difference (SD): Comparing children of eligible mothers born in June and July 1977.</li>
<li>Difference-in-differences (DD): Comparing the June-July difference in 1977 with other years.</li>
<li>Regression discontinuity (RD): Comparing births just before and after July 1, 1977.</li>
<li>Difference-in-regression discontinuity (RD-DD): Comparing the July 1 discontinuity in 1977 with other years.</li>
</ol>
<p>They used 1975, 1978, and 1979 as control years, intentionally excluding 1976 due to concerns about a new abortion law.</p>
</section>
<section id="our-reexamination-of-the-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-reexamination-of-the-data">Our reexamination of the data</h3>
<p>Given the correct interpretation of the reforms implementation, the above identification gives several points of concern. Especially:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>No Clear Discontinuity</strong>: Given the phased implementation of the reform, there was no sharp discontinuity on July 1, 1977, as assumed in the study.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Month-to-Month Fluctuations</strong>: Large, inconsistent fluctuations in outcomes between months across different years could lead to spurious results.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>June 1977 Anomaly</strong>: The study’s findings are heavily influenced by unusually poor outcomes for June 1977 births, particularly in earnings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Control Year Selection</strong>: The choice of control years significantly impacts the results. Including 1976 (which was excluded in the original study) would have led to different conclusions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We’ve created graphs showing average outcomes by birth month for dropout rates, college attendance, and log earnings at age 30.</p>

</figure>
<p>These graphs reveal:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Significant month-to-month variations that don’t follow consistent patterns across years.</li>
<li>The June 1977 cohort’s unexpectedly poor performance driving much of the perceived “improvement” in July.</li>
<li>Control years (1975, 1978, 1979) showing a June-to-July decline, contrasting with 1977’s pattern.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="implications-of-methodological-choices" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implications-of-methodological-choices">Implications of methodological choices</h3>
<p>These findings suggest that the positive effects reported in the CLS study may be artifacts of methodological choices rather than true reform impacts. The lack of a clear discontinuity and the sensitivity of results to control year selection call for caution in interpreting the study’s conclusions.</p>
<p>This reexamination underscores the importance of robust methodology in policy research and the need for careful consideration of historical context and data patterns.</p>
<p>(Note: Detailed references and data sources for all points made in this section can be found in our full article, which is linked in the introduction of this post.)</p>

<section id="methodological-discussion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methodological-discussion">Methodological discussion</h2>
<p>In our reexamination of the CLS study on Norway’s 1977 maternity leave reform, we uncovered several methodological decisions that warrant discussion. These choices, while often necessary in empirical research, can significantly influence results and interpretations.</p>
<section id="revisiting-control-year-selection" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="revisiting-control-year-selection">Revisiting Control Year Selection</h3>
<p>The CLS study excluded 1976 as a control year, citing concerns about a new abortion law. However, our investigation suggests this decision may need reconsideration:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 1976 abortion law revision largely formalized existing practices.</li>
<li>It had minimal impact on abortion rates or authorization practices.</li>
<li>In fact, abortion numbers slightly decreased in 1976.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, a more substantial change in abortion law occurred in 1979, introducing full self-determination in early pregnancy, yet even this had little effect on abortion numbers.</p>
</section>
<section id="key-methodological-observations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-methodological-observations">Key Methodological Observations</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Eligibility Criteria</strong>: The study’s eligibility requirements for maternity leave were based on inflated earnings figures, potentially including many ineligible women in the treatment group.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Outcome Definitions</strong>: The earnings outcome at age 30 included social insurance payments, which may distort its interpretation as a labor market success indicator.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Age Discrepancies</strong>: Contrary to the study’s description, earnings for some cohorts were measured at ages 28 or 29, not 30.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sample Selection</strong>: The study excluded individuals with missing education data, effectively omitting those educated abroad.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="robustness-analysis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="robustness-analysis">Robustness Analysis</h3>
<p>We conducted a robustness analysis, replicating the CLS study with various modifications, shown in figure 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjusting the eligibility criterion</li>
<li>Including previously omitted control years</li>
<li>Amending outcome definitions</li>
<li>Extending the time window around the reform</li>
</ul>
<p>Our findings show that these adjustments consistently move the estimated effects towards zero or statistical insignificance.</p>
</section>
<section id="reassessing-the-reforms-impact" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reassessing-the-reforms-impact">Reassessing the Reform’s Impact</h3>
<p>When we analyze the reform based on its correct implementation details, comparing offspring born after July 1, 1977, with those born before April 9, and adjusting for public sector employment, we find no significant effects across various identification strategies.</p>
</section>
<section id="visualizing-the-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="visualizing-the-data">Visualizing the Data</h3>
<p>We’ve created graphs showing average outcomes by birth month for dropout rates, college attendance, and log earnings at age 30.</p>
<figure style="width: 160%; margin-left: -25%; text-align: center;" class="figure">
<img src="images/pic3.jpg" alt="Estimates based on alternative datasets, treatment eligibility criteria, and model specifications (with 95% confidence intervals)" style="width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: none;" class="figure-img">

Figure 2. Estimates based on alternative datasets, treatment eligibility criteria, and model specifications (with 95% confidence intervals) <br> <em>Note:</em> Estimates marked “CLS 2015” are from the JPE article. Estimates marked “CLS replication 2022” are based on correspondence with the authors through JPE (RD-DD) or calculated by us based on monthly replication data provided to us by the CLS-team. All other estimates are based on our own replication (LMRZ).
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The originally reported effects, when viewed in light of the actual reform (a 5-6 week extension of existing leave), raise questions about plausibility. It’s challenging to reconcile how such a modest change could result in a 5% increase in offspring earnings 30 years later.</p>
<p>This reexamination highlights how methodological choices, combined with mischaracterization of policy changes, can lead to potentially misleading conclusions. It underscores the importance of accurate historical context and robust analytical approaches in policy research.</p>

<section id="publication-process" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="publication-process">Publication process</h2>
<p>Our reexamination of two influential studies on Norway’s 1977 maternity leave reform has yielded important insights, not just about the specific policy, but also about research practices in economics. In terms of publishing, we feel that the final published paper in JPE lacks several important insights in this story. We initially submitted the paper to JPE in the autumn of 2021, after having had several emails back and forth with the original authors. Based on these e-mails, it was clear that we had a completely different understanding of the implications we`ve been through in this post, thus prompting us to submit a paper where we discuss the insights provided above. This is fine, and we were also given early indication that the original authors were going to be included in the process. This is also fine. What is not fine, in our view, is the process from there. In april 2008, the editor wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Given the reviewers’ comments, I also think it would be nice to see some of the key graphs for outcomes by week or month of birth in 1977 (also, the difference between 1977 and average of other years), perhaps along with simple fitted linear models allowing for jumps and linear trend breaks at points of contention (e.g., for private reform, April 9 and July 1). For the two public reforms, there is also a ‘gray’ area, so there would be another region. If you could get decent prediction models for the P_j(Z) to break mothers into groups, you could show the graphs/fitted lines for each of the different ‘groups’ around their relevant dates. Of course, this might be too much to ask, especially for the public reforms. In any event, this would get at the heart of whether and when the policy might have had its impacts (e.g., around April 9 or closer to July 1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We do feel that we complied with the request. However, upon a new submission, we got the following reply in early 2023:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>On the plus side, I think there is general consensus that (i) CLS mischaracterized the policy, (ii) a more accurate interpretation of the policy suggests that the RD design is inappropriate, and (iii) a differences-in-differences strategy comparing pre-April 8 with post-July 1 for 1977 vs.&nbsp;other “control” years is a better approach; although, it clearly makes stronger assumptions than the original RD or RD-DD designs. The comment is on solid ground on points (i) and (ii), while I can envision a reply by CLS that (quickly) makes the case for (iii). The comment is on weaker footing when it steps beyond a description of the error by CLS and correcting the policy description.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What perhaps struck us by the comment, and by a reviewers comment, was the following</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>More generally, I think you need to acknowledge the possibility that there could be a discontinuity at July 1 (for reasons mentioned by the reviewer) even if you make the case that you don’t think this could have been very strong (especially relative to the magnitude of effects coming from the RD).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which we find odd given the compelling evidence of how the reform actually was implemented. Yet, the editor thought the figure one (also figure one in this post) was usefull. However, in may 2023, we got the following reply from the editor:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t think we learn much from your search for specifications that produces insignificant results. I have tried to be flexible in allowing you to make the case for this material, but I am still not convinced that you have uncovered much along these lines that is worthy of a top journal. I would be perfectly happy if your comment ended with a short concluding paragraph after section 2. You seem reluctant to go this route.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After another try, we complied with the comment, even if we strongly disagreed. The paper, as linked to in the introduction, was accepted for publication in July 2023. When was the paper published online as just accepted? July 2024. This implies that the original authors had an entire year to create a reply to us. Given the editors comment that our methodological contribution was not worthy of a top journal, we find it interesting that the same journal allowed the original authors to run a long set of regressions proving that even though the reform was interpreted differently, there is still some effect. The main result from the response by CLS (in our view) is the following:</p>

<li><p><strong>Invalid Identification Strategy</strong>: The reform was implemented gradually, not with a sharp cutoff date as assumed in the studies. This means the treatment and control groups often had identical maternity leave conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Replication Results</strong>: Our replication of the CLS study, using currently available data, initially produced similar results. However, when we adjusted for data irregularities and made methodological modifications, the reported effects disappeared.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Publication Process</strong>: We do not agree with how the editor of JPE delt with this process, and we find it odd that CLS were given carte blanche in their response to us whereas we underwent scrutiny to the extent that none of the material that could have refuted CLS’s response were added to our paper.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Importance of Institutional Details</strong>: Accurate understanding of policy specifics is crucial. In this case, the mischaracterization of the reform led to misinterpretation of results.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Caution with Missing “First Stage” Data</strong>: When direct data on policy implementation (e.g., parental leave take-up) is unavailable, extra scrutiny is warranted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Awareness of Researcher Degrees of Freedom</strong>: The wealth of data and analytical tools available today means researchers face many decision points. This flexibility can inadvertently lead to finding significant results by chance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Balancing Novelty and Accuracy</strong>: The pressure to publish novel, significant findings in top journals may unintentionally bias researchers towards confirming rather than challenging their hypotheses.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This case study serves as a reminder of the complexities inherent in empirical research.</p>
