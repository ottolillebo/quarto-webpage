    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nIn their 2015 study, Carneiro, Løken, and Salvanes (2015) (CLS) described the 1977 reform in Norway as introducing paid maternity leave for the first time. In reality, the reform extended the existing paid leave by five to six weeks, with a staggered implementation across different employment sectors.\nThis distinction is crucial because the original analysis assumed that only mothers giving birth after July 1, 1977, were entitled to paid leave. This cutoff was used to claim benefits for children. Our analysis shows that this assumption was incorrect: there was no sharp difference between mothers giving birth before and after this date. Consequently, the reported effects cannot be attributed to the reform as previously suggested.\nKey issues raised by our analysis include:\n\nReform characterization: The 1977 reform extended paid leave from 12 to 18 weeks, rather than introducing it.\nImplementation timeline: The extension was applied in stages (January 1, May 1, and July 1), depending on the mother’s employment sector, not on a single date.\nMethodology considerations: The discontinuity used by CLS to identify causal effects did not exist, making the analysis based on an invalid identification strategy.\n\nThis reexamination underscores the complexity of policy research and the need for careful review of influential studies. As debates on parental leave policies continue, it’s essential to consider multiple perspectives on how reforms were implemented and interpreted. Moreover, other researchers, including Bütikofer, Riise, and M. Skira (2021), have referenced CLS’s description of the reform, further highlighting the importance of accurate reform characterization."

    "text": "Norway’s 1977 Maternity Leave Reform\nThe CLS study described the 1977 reform as: - Increasing mandatory paid maternity leave from 0 to 18 weeks. - Raising compensation to 100% of pre-birth salary. - Extending unpaid leave from 12 to 52 weeks, in addition to the 18 paid weeks.\nHowever, historical records paint a very different picture: - Paid maternity leave actually increased from 12 (or 13 for public sector employees) to 18 weeks. - Paid maternity leave had existed in Norway since at least the 1930s. - The raise to 100% compensation was implemented a year later, on July 1, 1978. - The total leave period (paid plus unpaid) was extended to 52 weeks, not 52 weeks on top of the 18 paid weeks.\nThe CLS study also claimed: - A sharp discontinuity in entitlement on July 1, 1977. - Poor media coverage, making the reform largely unexpected.\nOur findings, however, show: - The reform was implemented in stages: January 1 for state employees, May 1 for other public sector workers, and July 1 for the private sector. - The extension applied to births in the months preceding each implementation date. - There was significant media coverage and political discussion in the years leading up to 1977.\nThese discrepancies raise important questions about the CLS study’s methodology and conclusions. The absence of a sharp entitlement cutoff and the gradual implementation challenge the study’s analytical approach."

    "section": "Identification",
    "text": "Identification\nThe CLS study on Norway’s 1977 maternity leave reform reported significant positive effects on children’s educational attainment and adult earnings. However, a closer examination of their methodology and data raises some important questions.\n\nThe Approach by CLS\nCLS used several statistical techniques to identify the effects of the reform:\n\nSingle-difference (SD): Comparing children of eligible mothers born in June and July 1977.\nDifference-in-differences (DD): Comparing the June-July difference in 1977 with other years.\nRegression discontinuity (RD): Comparing births just before and after July 1, 1977.\nDifference-in-regression discontinuity (RD-DD): Comparing the July 1 discontinuity in 1977 with other years.\n\nThey used 1975, 1978, and 1979 as control years, intentionally excluding 1976 due to concerns about a new abortion law.\n\n\nOur reexamination of the data\nGiven the correct interpretation of the reforms implementation, the above identification gives several points of concern. Especially:\n\nNo Clear Discontinuity: Given the phased implementation of the reform, there was no sharp discontinuity on July 1, 1977, as assumed in the study.\nMonth-to-Month Fluctuations: Large, inconsistent fluctuations in outcomes between months across different years could lead to spurious results.\nJune 1977 Anomaly: The study’s findings are heavily influenced by unusually poor outcomes for June 1977 births, particularly in earnings.\nControl Year Selection: The choice of control years significantly impacts the results. Including 1976 (which was excluded in the original study) would have led to different conclusions.\n\nWe’ve created graphs showing average outcomes by birth month for dropout rates, college attendance, and log earnings at age 30.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Average main outcomes by birth month  Note: The graphs are based on the original data used by CLS in the JPE paper and follow their definitions of outcomes and eligibility.  Click image to expand\n\n\n\n\n× \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese graphs reveal:\n\nSignificant month-to-month variations that don’t follow consistent patterns across years.\nThe June 1977 cohort’s unexpectedly poor performance driving much of the perceived “improvement” in July.\nControl years (1975, 1978, 1979) showing a June-to-July decline, contrasting with 1977’s pattern.\n\n\n\nImplications of methodological choices\nThese findings suggest that the positive effects reported in the CLS study may be artifacts of methodological choices rather than true reform impacts. The lack of a clear discontinuity and the sensitivity of results to control year selection call for caution in interpreting the study’s conclusions."

    "text": "Methodological discussion\nIn our reexamination of the CLS study on Norway’s 1977 maternity leave reform, we identified several methodological decisions that significantly influence results and interpretations.\n\nMethodological Concerns\n\nEligibility Criteria: The study’s maternity leave eligibility was based on inflated earnings figures, potentially including many ineligible women in the treatment group.\nOutcome Definitions: Earnings at age 30 included social insurance payments, which may distort its interpretation as a labor market success indicator.\nAge Discrepancies: Earnings for some cohorts were measured at ages 28 or 29, not 30 as described by CLS.\nSample Selection: Excluding individuals with missing education data effectively omitted those educated abroad.\n\nThe CLS study excluded 1976 as a control year due to a new abortion law. However, our investigation suggests this decision warrants reconsideration. The 1976 law largely formalized existing practices, with minimal impact on abortion rates or authorization procedures. In fact, abortion numbers slightly decreased in 1976. A more substantial change occurred in 1979, when full self-determination in early pregnancy was introduced, yet even this had little effect on abortion rates.\n\n\nRobustness of Findings\nWe replicated the CLS study with modifications, such as adjusting the eligibility criterion, including previously omitted control years, amending outcome definitions, and extending the time window around the reform. As shown in Figure 2, these adjustments consistently shift the estimated effects towards zero or statistical insignificance.\n\n\nReassessing the Reform’s Impact\nWhen we analyze the reform based on its correct implementation details, comparing offspring born after July 1, 1977, with those born before April 9, and adjusting for public sector employment, we find no significant effects across various identification strategies.\nAnalyzing the reform with corrected implementation details—comparing offspring born after July 1, 1977, with those born before April 9, and adjusting for public sector employment—we find no significant effects across various identification strategies. Additionally, outcomes depicting average outcomes by birth month for dropout rates, college attendance, and log earnings at age 30 support our findings.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Estimates based on alternative datasets, treatment eligibility criteria, and model specifications (with 95% confidence intervals)  Note: Estimates marked “CLS 2015” are from the JPE article. Estimates marked “CLS replication 2022” are based on correspondence with the authors through JPE (RD-DD) or calculated by us based on monthly replication data provided to us by CLS.

It’s challenging to reconcile how such a modest change could result in a 5% increase in offspring earnings 30 years later."

    "text": "Summary and final thoughts\nOur reexamination of the studies by Carneiro, Løken, and Salvanes (2015) reveals critical mischaracterizations of Norway’s 1977 maternity leave reform. Contrary to their claims, the reform did not introduce paid maternity leave but merely extended existing paid leave from 12 to 18 weeks. Furthermore, the studies’ identification strategy, assuming a sharp cutoff date for the reform’s implementation, is flawed. In reality, the reform was rolled out gradually, meaning the supposed treatment and control groups often had identical maternity leave conditions. Our replication of the CLS study initially produced results similar to those reported. However, once we corrected data irregularities and made necessary methodological adjustments, the effects largely disappeared.\nThis case highlights several important lessons for empirical research. First, accurate knowledge of institutional details is essential— mischaracterizing the reform led to erroneous interpretations of its impact. Second, researchers should be cautious when working without direct data on policy implementation, as in the case of missing parental leave take-up data. Additionally, the growing flexibility in data analysis can result in significant findings that are more a product of researcher degrees of freedom than true effects. Finally, the pressure to produce novel findings may bias researchers toward confirming their hypotheses, rather than challenging them.\n(Note: Detailed references and data sources for all points made in this section can be found in our full article, which is linked in the introduction of this blog post.)"
