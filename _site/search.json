    "text": "Background\n\nThe Study’s Findings\nThe CLS study suggested that Norway’s 1977 reform: - Introduced paid maternity leave - Changed the policy from 12 weeks of unpaid leave to 18 weeks of paid leave - Applied to mothers who gave birth after July 1, 1977 - Was associated with improved outcomes for children, including higher education levels and approximately 5% higher wages at age 30\nThese findings were notable because they appeared to demonstrate benefits from the introduction of paid leave, which contrasted with some other studies that found limited impacts from extending existing paid leave programs.\n\n\nOur Reexamination\nOur analysis raises questions about important aspects of the CLS study:\n\nReform characterization: We question whether the 1977 change introduced paid leave or extended existing paid leave from 12 to 18 weeks.\nImplementation timeline: We show that the reform were implemented in stages (January 1, May 1, and July 1) depending on the mother’s employment sector, rather than on a single date.\nMethodology considerations: We conclude that the discontinuity used by CLS to identify the causal effects never existed, and the analysis thus builds on an invalid identification strategy and an erroneous interpretation of the evaluated treatment effect.\n\nThese points suggest that further examination of the study’s assumptions and analysis may be warranted.This examination was part of our initial submission to JPE, but not part of the final published version:\n\n\nBroader Context\nThe interpretation of this Norwegian reform has influenced academic and policy discussions in several ways:\n\nIt has contributed to arguments about the relative importance of initial weeks of paid leave versus further extensions.\nOther researchers have referenced the study’s description of the reform in their own work. Notably Bütikofer, Riise, and M. Skira (2021).\nThe apparent contrast with other studies (which found limited benefits from extending existing paid leave) has been a point of discussion in the field.\n\nThis reexamination highlights the complexity of policy research and the importance of continual review and discussion of influential studies. As the debate on parental leave policies continues, it’s valuable to consider multiple perspectives and interpretations of historical reforms and their impacts."

    "text": "Norway’s 1977 Maternity Leave Reform\n\nThe Reform’s Content\nThe CLS study described the reform as: - Increasing mandatory paid maternity leave from 0 to 18 weeks - Raising compensation to 100% of pre-birth salary - Extending unpaid leave from 12 to 52 weeks, in addition to the 18 paid weeks\nHowever, historical records suggest a different picture: - Paid maternity leave actually increased from 12 (or 13 in the public sector) to 18 weeks - Paid maternity leave had existed in Norway since at least the 1930s - The raise to 100% compensation was implemented a year later, on July 1, 1978 - The total leave period (paid plus unpaid) was extended to 52 weeks, not 52 weeks on top of paid leave\n\n\nThe Reform’s Implementation\nThe CLS study claimed: - A sharp discontinuity in entitlement on July 1, 1977 - Poor media coverage, making the reform largely unexpected\nOur findings indicate: - The reform was implemented in stages: January 1 for state employees, May 1 for other public sector workers, and July 1 for the private sector - The extension was phased in, applying to births in the months preceding each implementation date - There was significant media coverage and political discussion of the reform in the years leading up to 1977\n\n\nImplications\nThese discrepancies raise important questions about the study’s methodology and conclusions. The lack of a sharp discontinuity in entitlement and the more gradual nature of the reform’s implementation challenge the study’s analytical approach.\nIt’s worth noting that an earlier working paper by the same authors provided a more accurate description of the reform. This evolution in the study’s presentation of the reform highlights the complexity of policy research and the importance of thorough historical verification.\n(Note: Detailed references for all points made in this section can be found in our full article, which is linked in the introduction of this blog post.)"

    "section": "Identification",
    "text": "Identification\nThe CLS study on Norway’s 1977 maternity leave reform reported significant positive effects on children’s educational attainment and adult earnings. However, a closer examination of their methodology and data raises some important questions.\n\nThe Study’s Approach\nCLS used several statistical techniques to identify the effects of the reform:\n\nSingle-difference (SD): Comparing children of eligible mothers born in June and July 1977.\nDifference-in-differences (DD): Comparing the June-July difference in 1977 with other years.\nRegression discontinuity (RD): Comparing births just before and after July 1, 1977.\nDifference-in-regression discontinuity (RD-DD): Comparing the July 1 discontinuity in 1977 with other years.\n\nThey used 1975, 1978, and 1979 as control years, intentionally excluding 1976 due to concerns about a new abortion law.\n\n\nQuestioning the Methodology\nOur reexamination of the data reveals several points of concern:\n\nNo Clear Discontinuity: Given the phased implementation of the reform, there was no sharp discontinuity on July 1, 1977, as assumed in the study.\nMonth-to-Month Fluctuations: Large, inconsistent fluctuations in outcomes between months across different years could lead to spurious results.\nJune 1977 Anomaly: The study’s findings are heavily influenced by unusually poor outcomes for June 1977 births, particularly in earnings.\nControl Year Selection: The choice of control years significantly impacts the results. Including 1976 (which was excluded in the original study) would have led to different conclusions.\n\n\n\nVisualizing the Data\nWe’ve created graphs showing average outcomes by birth month for dropout rates, college attendance, and log earnings at age 30.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Average main outcomes by birth month  Note: The graphs are based on the original data used by CLS in the JPE paper and follow their definitions of outcomes and eligibility.\n\n\nThese graphs reveal:\n\nSignificant month-to-month variations that don’t follow consistent patterns across years.\nThe June 1977 cohort’s unexpectedly poor performance driving much of the perceived “improvement” in July.\nControl years (1975, 1978, 1979) showing a June-to-July decline, contrasting with 1977’s pattern.\n\n\n\nDiscussing the exlusion of 1976\n\nThe 1976 abortion law change formalized existing practices and didn’t significantly impact abortion numbers.\nAbortion numbers actually decreased slightly in 1976.\nIncluding 1976 as a control year would align more closely with 1977’s patterns.\n\n\n\nImplications of methodological choices\nThese findings suggest that the positive effects reported in the CLS study may be artifacts of methodological choices rather than true reform impacts. The lack of a clear discontinuity and the sensitivity of results to control year selection call for caution in interpreting the study’s conclusions.\nThis reexamination underscores the importance of robust methodology in policy research and the need for careful consideration of historical context and data patterns.\n(Note: Detailed references and data sources for all points made in this section can be found in our full article, which is linked in the introduction of this post.)"

    "section": "Methodological Choices and Their Impacts: A Closer Look at the CLS Study",
    "text": "Methodological Choices and Their Impacts: A Closer Look at the CLS Study\nIn our reexamination of the CLS study on Norway’s 1977 maternity leave reform, we uncovered several methodological decisions that warrant discussion. These choices, while often necessary in empirical research, can significantly influence results and interpretations.\n\nRevisiting Control Year Selection\nThe CLS study excluded 1976 as a control year, citing concerns about a new abortion law. However, our investigation suggests this decision may need reconsideration:\n\nThe 1976 abortion law revision largely formalized existing practices.\nIt had minimal impact on abortion rates or authorization practices.\nIn fact, abortion numbers slightly decreased in 1976.\n\nInterestingly, a more substantial change in abortion law occurred in 1979, introducing full self-determination in early pregnancy, yet even this had little effect on abortion numbers.\n\n\nKey Methodological Observations\n\nEligibility Criteria: The study’s eligibility requirements for maternity leave were based on inflated earnings figures, potentially including many ineligible women in the treatment group.\nOutcome Definitions: The earnings outcome at age 30 included social insurance payments, which may distort its interpretation as a labor market success indicator.\nAge Discrepancies: Contrary to the study’s description, earnings for some cohorts were measured at ages 28 or 29, not 30.\nSample Selection: The study excluded individuals with missing education data, effectively omitting those educated abroad.\n\n\n\nRobustness Analysis\nWe conducted a robustness analysis, replicating the CLS study with various modifications, shown in figure 2:\n\nAdjusting the eligibility criterion\nIncluding previously omitted control years\nAmending outcome definitions\nExtending the time window around the reform\n\nOur findings show that these adjustments consistently move the estimated effects towards zero or statistical insignificance.\n\n\nReassessing the Reform’s Impact\nWhen we analyze the reform based on its correct implementation details, comparing offspring born after July 1, 1977, with those born before April 9, and adjusting for public sector employment, we find no significant effects across various identification strategies.\n\n\nVisualizing the Data\nWe’ve created graphs showing average outcomes by birth month for dropout rates, college attendance, and log earnings at age 30.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Estimates based on alternative datasets, treatment eligibility criteria, and model specifications (with 95% confidence intervals)  Note: Estimates marked “CLS 2015” are from the JPE article. Estimates marked “CLS replication 2022” are based on correspondence with the authors through JPE (RD-DD) or calculated by us based on monthly replication data provided to us by the CLS-team. All other estimates are based on our own replication (LMRZ).\n\n\nThe originally reported effects, when viewed in light of the actual reform (a 5-6 week extension of existing leave), raise questions about plausibility. It’s challenging to reconcile how such a modest change could result in a 5% increase in offspring earnings 30 years later.\nThis reexamination highlights how methodological choices, combined with mischaracterization of policy changes, can lead to potentially misleading conclusions. It underscores the importance of accurate historical context and robust analytical approaches in policy research.\n(Note: Detailed references, data sources, and additional analyses mentioned here can be found in our full article, which is linked in the introduction of this blog post.)"

    "text": "Discussion and closing thoughts\nOur reexamination of two influential studies on Norway’s 1977 maternity leave reform has yielded important insights, not just about the specific policy, but also about research practices in economics.Here we summarize our findings and consider their broader implications.\n\nKey Findings\n\nMischaracterization of the Reform: The studies by Carneiro, Løken, and Salvanes (2015) and Bütikofer, Riise, and Skira (2021) were based on an incorrect description of the 1977 reform. Rather than introducing paid maternity leave, the reform extended existing paid leave from 12 to 18 weeks.\nInvalid Identification Strategy: The reform was implemented gradually, not with a sharp cutoff date as assumed in the studies. This means the treatment and control groups often had identical maternity leave conditions.\nReplication Results: Our replication of the CLS study, using currently available data, initially produced similar results. However, when we adjusted for data irregularities and made methodological modifications, the reported effects disappeared.\n\n\n\nLessons for Empirical Research\n\nImportance of Institutional Details: Accurate understanding of policy specifics is crucial. In this case, the mischaracterization of the reform led to misinterpretation of results.\nCaution with Missing “First Stage” Data: When direct data on policy implementation (e.g., parental leave take-up) is unavailable, extra scrutiny is warranted.\nAwareness of Researcher Degrees of Freedom: The wealth of data and analytical tools available today means researchers face many decision points. This flexibility can inadvertently lead to finding significant results by chance.\nBalancing Novelty and Accuracy: The pressure to publish novel, significant findings in top journals may unintentionally bias researchers towards confirming rather than challenging their hypotheses.\n\n\n\nBroader Reflections\nThis case study serves as a reminder of the complexities inherent in empirical research. It highlights the need for:\n\nRigorous verification of historical and institutional contexts\nCritical examination of methodological choices\nAwareness of potential biases in the research and publication process\n\nAs researchers, we must balance the pursuit of impactful findings with a commitment to accuracy and robustness. This experience offers valuable food for thought for all of us in the field of empirical economics research.\n(Note: Detailed references and data sources for all points made in this section can be found in our full article, which is linked in the introduction of this blog post.)"
