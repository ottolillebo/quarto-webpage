    "text": "Background\nIn their 2015 study, Carneiro, Løken, and Salvanes (2015) (CLS) described the 1977 reform in Norway as introducing paid maternity leave for the first time. In reality, the reform extended the existing paid leave by five to six weeks, with a staggered implementation across different employment sectors.\nThis distinction is crucial because the original analysis assumed that only mothers giving birth after July 1, 1977, were entitled to paid leave. This cutoff was used to claim benefits for children. Our analysis shows that this assumption was incorrect: there was no sharp difference between mothers giving birth before and after this date. Consequently, the reported effects cannot be attributed to the reform as previously suggested.\nKey issues raised by our analysis include:\n\nReform characterization: The 1977 reform extended paid leave from 12 to 18 weeks, rather than introducing it.\nImplementation timeline: The extension was applied in stages (January 1, May 1, and July 1), depending on the mother’s employment sector, not on a single date.\nMethodology considerations: The discontinuity used by CLS to identify causal effects did not exist, making the analysis based on an invalid identification strategy.\n\nThis reexamination underscores the complexity of policy research and the need for careful review of influential studies. As debates on parental leave policies continue, it’s essential to consider multiple perspectives on how reforms were implemented and interpreted. Moreover, other researchers, including Bütikofer, Riise, and M. Skira (2021), have referenced CLS’s description of the reform, further highlighting the importance of accurate reform characterization."

    "text": "Norway’s 1977 Maternity Leave Reform\nThe CLS study described the 1977 reform as: - Increasing mandatory paid maternity leave from 0 to 18 weeks. - Raising compensation to 100% of pre-birth salary. - Extending unpaid leave from 12 to 52 weeks, in addition to the 18 paid weeks.\nHowever, historical records paint a very different picture: - Paid maternity leave actually increased from 12 (or 13 for public sector employees) to 18 weeks. - Paid maternity leave had existed in Norway since at least the 1930s. - The raise to 100% compensation was implemented a year later, on July 1, 1978. - The total leave period (paid plus unpaid) was extended to 52 weeks, not 52 weeks on top of the 18 paid weeks.\nThe CLS study also claimed: - A sharp discontinuity in entitlement on July 1, 1977. - Poor media coverage, making the reform largely unexpected.\nOur findings, however, show: - The reform was implemented in stages: January 1 for state employees, May 1 for other public sector workers, and July 1 for the private sector. - The extension applied to births in the months preceding each implementation date. - There was significant media coverage and political discussion in the years leading up to 1977.\nThese discrepancies raise important questions about the CLS study’s methodology and conclusions. The absence of a sharp entitlement cutoff and the gradual implementation challenge the study’s analytical approach.\nInterestingly, an earlier working paper from 2008, offered a more accurate description of the reform. On page 10, the authors wrote:\n\nIn 1956 the maternity leave benefits became common to women in Norway through the introduction of compulsory sickness insurance for all employees. The length of the maternity leave was 12 weeks, but the compensation varied substantially (Rønsen and Sundström (2002)).1 From July 1st 1977 paid maternity leave was extended to 18 weeks and unpaid maternity leave up to one year.\n\nHowever, by 2010, a new working-paper stated:\n\nOn July 1st, 1977, Norway saw the introduction of paid maternity leave and an increase in unpaid leave.\n\nThis evolution in how the reform was presented highlights the complexity of policy research and the need for thorough historical verification."

    "text": "Identification\nThe CLS study on Norway’s 1977 maternity leave reform reported significant positive effects on children’s educational attainment and adult earnings. However, a closer examination of their methodology and data raises some important questions.\n\nThe Approach by CLS\nCLS used several statistical techniques to identify the effects of the reform:\n\nSingle-difference (SD): Comparing children of eligible mothers born in June and July 1977.\nDifference-in-differences (DD): Comparing the June-July difference in 1977 with other years.\nRegression discontinuity (RD): Comparing births just before and after July 1, 1977.\nDifference-in-regression discontinuity (RD-DD): Comparing the July 1 discontinuity in 1977 with other years.\n\nThey used 1975, 1978, and 1979 as control years, intentionally excluding 1976 due to concerns about a new abortion law.\n\n\nOur reexamination of the data\nGiven the correct interpretation of the reforms implementation, the above identification gives several points of concern. Especially:\n\nNo Clear Discontinuity: Given the phased implementation of the reform, there was no sharp discontinuity on July 1, 1977, as assumed in the study.\nMonth-to-Month Fluctuations: Large, inconsistent fluctuations in outcomes between months across different years could lead to spurious results.\nJune 1977 Anomaly: The study’s findings are heavily influenced by unusually poor outcomes for June 1977 births, particularly in earnings.\nControl Year Selection: The choice of control years significantly impacts the results. Including 1976 (which was excluded in the original study) would have led to different conclusions.\n\nWe’ve created graphs showing average outcomes by birth month for dropout rates, college attendance, and log earnings at age 30.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Average main outcomes by birth month  Note: The graphs are based on the original data used by CLS in the JPE paper and follow their definitions of outcomes and eligibility.  Click image to expand\n\n\n\n\n× \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese graphs reveal:\n\nSignificant month-to-month variations that don’t follow consistent patterns across years.\nThe June 1977 cohort’s unexpectedly poor performance driving much of the perceived “improvement” in July.\nControl years (1975, 1978, 1979) showing a June-to-July decline, contrasting with 1977’s pattern.\n\n\n\nImplications of methodological choices\nThese findings suggest that the positive effects reported in the CLS study may be artifacts of methodological choices rather than true reform impacts. The lack of a clear discontinuity and the sensitivity of results to control year selection call for caution in interpreting the study’s conclusions.\nThis reexamination underscores the importance of robust methodology in policy research and the need for careful consideration of historical context and data patterns.\n(Note: Detailed references and data sources for all points made in this section can be found in our full article, which is linked in the introduction of this post.)"

    "text": "Methodological discussion\nIn our reexamination of the CLS study on Norway’s 1977 maternity leave reform, we identified several methodological decisions that significantly influence results and interpretations.\n\nMethodological Concerns\n\nEligibility Criteria: The study’s maternity leave eligibility was based on inflated earnings figures, potentially including many ineligible women in the treatment group.\nOutcome Definitions: Earnings at age 30 included social insurance payments, which may distort its interpretation as a labor market success indicator.\nAge Discrepancies: Earnings for some cohorts were measured at ages 28 or 29, not 30 as described by CLS.\nSample Selection: Excluding individuals with missing education data effectively omitted those educated abroad.\n\nThe CLS study excluded 1976 as a control year due to a new abortion law. However, our investigation suggests this decision warrants reconsideration. The 1976 law largely formalized existing practices, with minimal impact on abortion rates or authorization procedures. In fact, abortion numbers slightly decreased in 1976. A more substantial change occurred in 1979, when full self-determination in early pregnancy was introduced, yet even this had little effect on abortion rates.\n\n\nRobustness of Findings\nWe replicated the CLS study with modifications, such as adjusting the eligibility criterion, including previously omitted control years, amending outcome definitions, and extending the time window around the reform. As shown in Figure 2, these adjustments consistently shift the estimated effects towards zero or statistical insignificance.\n\n\nReassessing the Reform’s Impact\nWhen we analyze the reform based on its correct implementation details, comparing offspring born after July 1, 1977, with those born before April 9, and adjusting for public sector employment, we find no significant effects across various identification strategies.\nAnalyzing the reform with corrected implementation details—comparing offspring born after July 1, 1977, with those born before April 9, and adjusting for public sector employment—we find no significant effects across various identification strategies. Additionally, outcomes depicting average outcomes by birth month for dropout rates, college attendance, and log earnings at age 30 support our findings.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Estimates based on alternative datasets, treatment eligibility criteria, and model specifications (with 95% confidence intervals)  Note: Estimates marked “CLS 2015” are from the JPE article.

It’s challenging to reconcile how such a modest change could result in a 5% increase in offspring earnings 30 years later.\nThis reexamination highlights how methodological choices, combined with mischaracterization of policy changes, can lead to potentially misleading conclusions. It underscores the importance of accurate historical context and robust analytical approaches in policy research.\n(Note: Detailed references, data sources, and additional analyses mentioned here can be found in our full article, which is linked in the introduction of this blog post.)"

    "text": "Publication process\nOur reexamination of two influential studies on Norway’s 1977 maternity leave reform has provided valuable insights, not only regarding the policy itself but also about research practices in economics. However, we believe the final paper published in the Journal of Political Economy (JPE) omits several critical aspects of this story.\nWe initially submitted our paper to JPE in the autumn of 2021, following several rounds of email correspondence with the original authors. From these exchanges, it became evident that we had a fundamentally different understanding of the key implications discussed in this post. This prompted us to submit a paper to JPE addressing the insights outlined above.\nAt first, the process seemed fair. We were informed that the original authors would be involved, which we understood and accepted. However, what followed was less acceptable. In April 2022, the editor wrote the following:\n\nGiven the reviewers’ comments, I also think it would be nice to see some of the key graphs for outcomes by week or month of birth in 1977 (also, the difference between 1977 and average of other years), perhaps along with simple fitted linear models allowing for jumps and linear trend breaks at points of contention (e.g., for private reform, April 9 and July 1). For the two public reforms, there is also a ‘gray’ area, so there would be another region. If you could get decent prediction models for the P_j(Z) to break mothers into groups, you could show the graphs/fitted lines for each of the different ‘groups’ around their relevant dates. Of course, this might be too much to ask, especially for the public reforms. In any event, this would get at the heart of whether and when the policy might have had its impacts (e.g., around April 9 or closer to July 1).\n\nUpon a new submission, where we included the analysis discussed above, we got the following reply in early 2023:\n\nOn the plus side, I think there is general consensus that (i) CLS mischaracterized the policy, (ii) a more accurate interpretation of the policy suggests that the RD design is inappropriate, and (iii) a differences-in-differences strategy comparing pre-April 8 with post-July 1 for 1977 vs. other “control” years is a better approach; although, it clearly makes stronger assumptions than the original RD or RD-DD designs. The comment is on solid ground on points (i) and (ii), while I can envision a reply by CLS that (quickly) makes the case for (iii). The comment is on weaker footing when it steps beyond a description of the error by CLS and correcting the policy description.\n\nWhat perhaps struck us by the comment, and by a reviewers comment, was the following\n\nMore generally, I think you need to acknowledge the possibility that there could be a discontinuity at July 1 (for reasons mentioned by the reviewer) even if you make the case that you don’t think this could have been very strong (especially relative to the magnitude of effects coming from the RD).\n\nWe found this response odd, given the compelling evidence of how the reform was actually implemented. Despite this, the editor acknowledged the usefulness of Figure 1 (also featured in this post). However, in May 2023, we received the following reply from the editor:\n\nUnfortunately, I don’t think we learn much from your search for specifications that produces insignificant results. I have tried to be flexible in allowing you to make the case for this material, but I am still not convinced that you have uncovered much along these lines that is worthy of a top journal. I would be perfectly happy if your comment ended with a short concluding paragraph after section 2. You seem reluctant to go this route.\n\nAfter another round of revisions, we complied with the editor’s comments, despite strongly disagreeing with them. The paper, as linked in the introduction, was accepted for publication in July 2023. It was then posted online as “just accepted” in July 2024, giving the original authors an entire year to prepare their response. Considering the editor’s remark that our methodological contribution was not significant enough for a top journal, it is interesting that the same journal allowed the original authors to run an extensive set of regressions to show that, despite a different interpretation of the reform, there is still some effect. In our view, the main takeaway from the CLS response is as follows:\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Table 1 in the response by CLS \n\n\nGiven what CLS write in the note, its a bit difficult to understand what they have done. But we have managed to [skriv inn litt mer]"

    "text": "Summary and final thoughts\nOur reexamination of the studies by Carneiro, Løken, and Salvanes (2015) reveals critical mischaracterizations of Norway’s 1977 maternity leave reform. Contrary to their claims, the reform did not introduce paid maternity leave but merely extended existing paid leave from 12 to 18 weeks. Furthermore, the studies’ identification strategy, assuming a sharp cutoff date for the reform’s implementation, is flawed. In reality, the reform was rolled out gradually, meaning the supposed treatment and control groups often had identical maternity leave conditions.\nOur replication of the CLS study initially produced results similar to those reported. However, once we corrected data irregularities and made necessary methodological adjustments, the effects largely disappeared. This process, particularly in light of how the Journal of Political Economy handled our submission, raises concerns. While CLS were given considerable freedom in their response to us, our paper was subject to intense scrutiny, and material that could have refuted CLS’s conclusions was excluded from the final version.\nThis case highlights several important lessons for empirical research. First, accurate knowledge of institutional details is essential—mischaracterizing the reform led to erroneous interpretations of its impact. Second, researchers should be cautious when working without direct data on policy implementation, as in the case of missing parental leave take-up data. Additionally, the growing flexibility in data analysis can result in significant findings that are more a product of researcher degrees of freedom than true effects. Finally, the pressure to produce novel findings may bias researchers toward confirming their hypotheses, rather than challenging them.\nIn conclusion, this case study underscores the complexities and challenges of empirical research, reminding us of the importance of rigor and transparency in analyzing policy impacts.\n(Note: Detailed references and data sources for all points made in this section can be found in our full article, which is linked in the introduction of this blog post.)"
