title: "Revisiting the 1977 Norwegian Maternity Leave Reform"
description: |
  In this post, we examine a widely cited study on Norway's 1977 maternity leave reform published in the Journal of Political Economy. We investigate how the characterization of policy changes can affect conclusions about their impacts. Our analysis reveals that the reform, described as introducing paid maternity leave, was actually an extension of existing benefits. We explore the implications of this finding for interpreting the study's conclusions on child outcomes.

## Introduction

A paper by @carneiro2015flying (CLS) published in Journal of Political Economy examined the effects of Norway's 1977 maternity leave reform. At the time of writing this post, the article has been cited around 480 times according to Google Scholar, and also included in one Norwegian Official Report.[^1] Their study concluded that the introduction of paid maternity leave had significant positive impacts on children's educational attainment and future earnings.

Our research has uncovered some important discrepancies in CLS's description of the reform and its implementation. These findings prompt a necessary reassessment of the original study's conclusions and methodology. In this post, we'll discuss:

-   The actual changes introduced by the 1977 reform
-   The timeline and implementation across different employment sectors of the 1977 reform
-   The implications of these corrections for the original study's findings
-   How JPE dealt with our findings
-   Scientific Integrity and reproducability in light of our article

## Background

### The Study's Findings

The CLS study suggested that Norway's 1977 reform: - Introduced paid maternity leave - Changed the policy from 12 weeks of unpaid leave to 18 weeks of paid leave - Applied to mothers who gave birth after July 1, 1977 - Was associated with improved outcomes for children, including higher education levels and approximately 5% higher wages at age 30

These findings were notable because they appeared to demonstrate benefits from the introduction of paid leave, which contrasted with some other studies that found limited impacts from extending existing paid leave programs.

### Our Reexamination

Our analysis raises questions about important aspects of the CLS study:

1.  **Reform characterization**: We question whether the 1977 change introduced paid leave or extended existing paid leave from 12 to 18 weeks.

2.  **Implementation timeline**: We show that the reform were implemented in stages (January 1, May 1, and July 1) depending on the mother's employment sector, rather than on a single date.

3.  **Methodology considerations**: We conclude that the discontinuity used by CLS to identify the causal effects never existed, and the analysis thus builds on an invalid identification strategy and an erroneous interpretation of the evaluated treatment effect.

These points suggest that further examination of the study's assumptions and analysis may be warranted.This examination was part of our initial submission to JPE, but not part of the final published version:

### Broader Context

The interpretation of this Norwegian reform has influenced academic and policy discussions in several ways:

-   It has contributed to arguments about the relative importance of initial weeks of paid leave versus further extensions.
-   Other researchers have referenced the study's description of the reform in their own work. Notably @butikofer2021impact.
-   The apparent contrast with other studies (which found limited benefits from extending existing paid leave) has been a point of discussion in the field.

This reexamination highlights the complexity of policy research and the importance of continual review and discussion of influential studies. As the debate on parental leave policies continues, it's valuable to consider multiple perspectives and interpretations of historical reforms and their impacts.

## Norway's 1977 Maternity Leave Reform

### The Reform's Content

The CLS study described the reform as: - Increasing mandatory paid maternity leave from 0 to 18 weeks - Raising compensation to 100% of pre-birth salary - Extending unpaid leave from 12 to 52 weeks, in addition to the 18 paid weeks

However, historical records suggest a different picture: - Paid maternity leave actually increased from 12 (or 13 in the public sector) to 18 weeks - Paid maternity leave had existed in Norway since at least the 1930s - The raise to 100% compensation was implemented a year later, on July 1, 1978 - The total leave period (paid plus unpaid) was extended to 52 weeks, not 52 weeks on top of paid leave

### The Reform's Implementation

The CLS study claimed: - A sharp discontinuity in entitlement on July 1, 1977 - Poor media coverage, making the reform largely unexpected

Our findings indicate: - The reform was implemented in stages: January 1 for state employees, May 1 for other public sector workers, and July 1 for the private sector - The extension was phased in, applying to births in the months preceding each implementation date - There was significant media coverage and political discussion of the reform in the years leading up to 1977

### Implications

These discrepancies raise important questions about the study's methodology and conclusions. The lack of a sharp discontinuity in entitlement and the more gradual nature of the reform's implementation challenge the study's analytical approach.

It's worth noting that an earlier working paper by the same authors provided a more accurate description of the reform. This evolution in the study's presentation of the reform highlights the complexity of policy research and the importance of thorough historical verification.

## Identification

The CLS study on Norway's 1977 maternity leave reform reported significant positive effects on children's educational attainment and adult earnings. However, a closer examination of their methodology and data raises some important questions.

### The Study's Approach

CLS used several statistical techniques to identify the effects of the reform:

1.  Single-difference (SD): Comparing children of eligible mothers born in June and July 1977.
2.  Difference-in-differences (DD): Comparing the June-July difference in 1977 with other years.
3.  Regression discontinuity (RD): Comparing births just before and after July 1, 1977.
4.  Difference-in-regression discontinuity (RD-DD): Comparing the July 1 discontinuity in 1977 with other years.

They used 1975, 1978, and 1979 as control years, intentionally excluding 1976 due to concerns about a new abortion law.

### Questioning the Methodology

Our reexamination of the data reveals several points of concern:

1.  **No Clear Discontinuity**: Given the phased implementation of the reform, there was no sharp discontinuity on July 1, 1977, as assumed in the study.

2.  **Month-to-Month Fluctuations**: Large, inconsistent fluctuations in outcomes between months across different years could lead to spurious results.

3.  **June 1977 Anomaly**: The study's findings are heavily influenced by unusually poor outcomes for June 1977 births, particularly in earnings.

4.  **Control Year Selection**: The choice of control years significantly impacts the results. Including 1976 (which was excluded in the original study) would have led to different conclusions.

### Visualizing the Data

We've created graphs showing average outcomes by birth month for dropout rates, college attendance, and log earnings at age 30.

</figure>

These graphs reveal:

1.  Significant month-to-month variations that don't follow consistent patterns across years.
2.  The June 1977 cohort's unexpectedly poor performance driving much of the perceived "improvement" in July.
3.  Control years (1975, 1978, 1979) showing a June-to-July decline, contrasting with 1977's pattern.

### Discussing the exlusion of 1976

-   The 1976 abortion law change formalized existing practices and didn't significantly impact abortion numbers.
-   Abortion numbers actually decreased slightly in 1976.
-   Including 1976 as a control year would align more closely with 1977's patterns.

### Implications of methodological choices

These findings suggest that the positive effects reported in the CLS study may be artifacts of methodological choices rather than true reform impacts. The lack of a clear discontinuity and the sensitivity of results to control year selection call for caution in interpreting the study's conclusions.

This reexamination underscores the importance of robust methodology in policy research and the need for careful consideration of historical context and data patterns.

## Methodological Choices and Their Impacts: A Closer Look at the CLS Study

In our reexamination of the CLS study on Norway's 1977 maternity leave reform, we uncovered several methodological decisions that warrant discussion. These choices, while often necessary in empirical research, can significantly influence results and interpretations.

### Revisiting Control Year Selection

The CLS study excluded 1976 as a control year, citing concerns about a new abortion law. However, our investigation suggests this decision may need reconsideration:

-   The 1976 abortion law revision largely formalized existing practices.
-   It had minimal impact on abortion rates or authorization practices.
-   In fact, abortion numbers slightly decreased in 1976.

Interestingly, a more substantial change in abortion law occurred in 1979, introducing full self-determination in early pregnancy, yet even this had little effect on abortion numbers.

### Key Methodological Observations

1.  **Eligibility Criteria**: The study's eligibility requirements for maternity leave were based on inflated earnings figures, potentially including many ineligible women in the treatment group.

2.  **Outcome Definitions**: The earnings outcome at age 30 included social insurance payments, which may distort its interpretation as a labor market success indicator.

3.  **Age Discrepancies**: Contrary to the study's description, earnings for some cohorts were measured at ages 28 or 29, not 30.

4.  **Sample Selection**: The study excluded individuals with missing education data, effectively omitting those educated abroad.

### Robustness Analysis

We conducted a robustness analysis, replicating the CLS study with various modifications, shown in figure 2:

-   Adjusting the eligibility criterion
-   Including previously omitted control years
-   Amending outcome definitions
-   Extending the time window around the reform

Our findings show that these adjustments consistently move the estimated effects towards zero or statistical insignificance.

### Reassessing the Reform's Impact

When we analyze the reform based on its correct implementation details, comparing offspring born after July 1, 1977, with those born before April 9, and adjusting for public sector employment, we find no significant effects across various identification strategies.

### Visualizing the Data

We've created graphs showing average outcomes by birth month for dropout rates, college attendance, and log earnings at age 30.

<figure style="width: 160%; margin-left: -25%; text-align: center;">

<img src="images/pic3.jpg" alt="Estimates based on alternative datasets, treatment eligibility criteria, and model specifications (with 95% confidence intervals)" style="width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: none;"/>

Estimates based on alternative datasets, treatment eligibility criteria, and model specifications (with 95% confidence intervals) <br> <em>Note:</em> Estimates marked "CLS 2015" are from the JPE article. Estimates marked "CLS replication 2022" are based on correspondence with the authors through JPE (RD-DD) or calculated by us based on monthly replication data provided to us by the CLS-team. All other estimates are based on our own replication (LMRZ).

The originally reported effects, when viewed in light of the actual reform (a 5-6 week extension of existing leave), raise questions about plausibility. It's challenging to reconcile how such a modest change could result in a 5% increase in offspring earnings 30 years later.

This reexamination highlights how methodological choices, combined with mischaracterization of policy changes, can lead to potentially misleading conclusions. It underscores the importance of accurate historical context and robust analytical approaches in policy research.

## Discussion and closing thoughts

Our reexamination of two influential studies on Norway's 1977 maternity leave reform has yielded important insights, not just about the specific policy, but also about research practices in economics.Here we summarize our findings and consider their broader implications.

### Key Findings

1.  **Mischaracterization of the Reform**: The studies by Carneiro, Løken, and Salvanes (2015) and Bütikofer, Riise, and Skira (2021) were based on an incorrect description of the 1977 reform. Rather than introducing paid maternity leave, the reform extended existing paid leave from 12 to 18 weeks.

2.  **Invalid Identification Strategy**: The reform was implemented gradually, not with a sharp cutoff date as assumed in the studies. This means the treatment and control groups often had identical maternity leave conditions.

3.  **Replication Results**: Our replication of the CLS study, using currently available data, initially produced similar results. However, when we adjusted for data irregularities and made methodological modifications, the reported effects disappeared.

### Lessons for Empirical Research

1.  **Importance of Institutional Details**: Accurate understanding of policy specifics is crucial. In this case, the mischaracterization of the reform led to misinterpretation of results.

2.  **Caution with Missing "First Stage" Data**: When direct data on policy implementation (e.g., parental leave take-up) is unavailable, extra scrutiny is warranted.

3.  **Awareness of Researcher Degrees of Freedom**: The wealth of data and analytical tools available today means researchers face many decision points. This flexibility can inadvertently lead to finding significant results by chance.

4.  **Balancing Novelty and Accuracy**: The pressure to publish novel, significant findings in top journals may unintentionally bias researchers towards confirming rather than challenging their hypotheses.

### Broader Reflections

This case study serves as a reminder of the complexities inherent in empirical research. It highlights the need for:

-   Rigorous verification of historical and institutional contexts
-   Critical examination of methodological choices
-   Awareness of potential biases in the research and publication process

As researchers, we must balance the pursuit of impactful findings with a commitment to accuracy and robustness. This experience offers valuable food for thought for all of us in the field of empirical economics research.
